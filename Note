6. Main Components/Features

7. User-Astrologer Distribution Logic (distributionService.js)
   This service distributes users to astrologers based on their current load.
   Top astrologers can handle up to 20% more users.
   Astrologers are sorted by their load, and users are assigned to the least-loaded astrologer.
8. Astrologer Management (astrologerController.js)
   Toggle the status of an astrologer between "Top" and "Normal".
   The system randomly assigns about 30% of astrologers as "Top" astrologers at the start.
9. User Distribution Endpoint (userController.js)
   Distribute users to astrologers through the /distributeUsers API endpoint.
